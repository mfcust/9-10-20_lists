###Here is my list from the README file
fav_foods = ['pizza', 'cheesecake', 'burritos', 'donuts']


###Let's say I want to access the food at index position 2. This looks like the following line of code:
print(fav_foods[2])


### 1) Which food in my list does this line of code output? What does this tell us about where the index position starts?



###If I want to access multiple items in my list, I can provide a range separated by a colon when I index my list. Uncomment the next line of code to observe
#print(fave_foods[1:3])



### 2) How many foods in the list did the code on line 14 print? Is this what you expected?




### 3) A list doesn't need to contain only one type of data. Create a list variable named diff_types that contains different data types (e.g. strings, integers, floats, etc.)




### You can also create a list of lists!! This is most easily accomplished by creating list variables and then creating a list of those variables.
### 4)Create a list variable of some hobbies (e.g. hobbies = ['hobby1', 'hobby2', 'hobby3']) and a list variable of your favorite foods, and then create a list of those two list variables
###This is called a nested list (inception of lists!!!)





### 5) Try out the .append() method on one of your lists. (e.g. hobbies.append('basketball'), then print(hobbies). What happened?




### 6) Try out del on an index position in your list (e.g. del hobbies[1]) and then print your list again. What happened?





###Bonuses

# 1) Can we do arithmetic with lists? Take two of the list variables that you created earlier in this assignment and try adding/subtracting/dividing/multiplying them together.
#### Which ones work and which ones don't?





# 2a) If I wanted to print every item in a list except for the first item using indexing, but I didn't know how long the list was, how would I do it?
# Hint: You already know how to index a specific range (e.g. hobbies[1:5])




#2b) If I wanted to print every item in a list except for the last item, but I didn't know how long the list was, how would I do it?
