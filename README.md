# Lists

What is a list? It is a data type that has a countable number of ordered values. If I wanted to create a list of my favorite foods, it would look something like this:

```
fav_foods = ['pizza', 'cheesecake', 'burritos','donuts']
print(fav_foods)
```

If I wanted to access a specific item in my list, then I could specify it's *index position*. In order to index my list, I can add brackets to my list variable and specify the index position. For example:

```
fav_foods[2]
```
